We have NODES A,B,C and PODS A,B,C how will you ensure that pod A goes to A node, B goes to B and C goes to C node and no other case happens

<details>
You can use `nodeSelector` and label the nodes.
Label Node A as a:a and give this lablel to `nodeSelector`. Similarly
Label Node B as b:b
Label Node C as c:c
