- To get access to your bucket again, sign in to the Amazon S3 console as the AWS account root user, and then delete the bucket policy.

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket MyBucket --policy file://policy.json
```


```json
{
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/*"
      },

### Managing Storage

[How can I retrieve an Amazon S3 object that was deleted in a versioning-enabled bucket?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-undelete-configuration/)

- When you delete an object from a version-enabled bucket, Amazon S3 creates a delete marker for the object. The delete marker becomes the current version of the object, and the actual object becomes the previous version. With a delete marker, Amazon S3 responds to requests for the object as though the object was deleted. For example, if you send a GET request for the object, then Amazon S3 returns an error.
