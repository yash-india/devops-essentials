- Each copy operation has some overhead because of encryption
- To speed up the process of transferring small files to your AWS Snowball Edge device, you can batch them together in a single archive.
- When you batch files together, they can be auto-extracted when they are imported into Amazon S3, if they were batched in one of the supported archive formats.
