[Cheat Sheet - Mechanical Turk](https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-mechanical-turk)

- Is a crowdsourcing marketplace that connects you with an on-demand, scalable, human workforce to complete tasks.
- Using Mechanical Turk, you can programmatically direct tasks to the Mechanical Turk marketplace, where they can be completed by workers around the world.
- Mechanical Turk allows you to access the intelligence, skills, and insights of a global workforce for tasks as varied as data categorization, moderation, data collection and analysis, behavioral studies, and image annotation.
- Mechanical Turk is built around the concept of microtasks, which are small, atomic tasks that workers can complete in their web browser.
- When you submit work to Mechanical Turk, you typically start by breaking it into smaller tasks on which workers can work independently. 
- In this way, a project involving categorizing 10,000 images becomes 10,000 individual microtasks that workers can complete.
