# ControlTower

- AWS Organizations is an account management service that lets you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage
- With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization. 
- You can organize those accounts into groups and attach policy-based controls
- In AWS Control Tower, Organizations helps centrally manage billing; control access, compliance, and security; and share resources across your member AWS accounts. 
- Accounts are grouped into logical groups, called organizational units (OUs)
