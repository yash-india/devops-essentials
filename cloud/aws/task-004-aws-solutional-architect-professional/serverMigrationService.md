[AWS Server Migration Service â€“ Server Migration to the Cloud Made Easy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-server-migration-service-server-migration-to-the-cloud-made-easy)

- AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS) automates the migration of your on-premises VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V/SCVMM, and Azure virtual machines to the AWS Cloud.
- AWS SMS incrementally replicates your server VMs as cloud-hosted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) ready for deployment on Amazon EC2. Working with AMIs, you can easily test and update your cloud-based images before deploying them in production.


## Migrate Application

- AWS Server Migration Service supports the automated migration of multi-server application stacks from your on-premises data center to Amazon EC2
- Where server migration is accomplished by replicating a single server as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), application migration replicates all of the servers in an application as AMIs and generates an AWS CloudFormation template to launch them in a coordinated fashion.
