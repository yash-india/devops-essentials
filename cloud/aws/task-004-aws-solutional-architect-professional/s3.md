[What is Amazon S3?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 


## Amazon S3 Event Notifications

[Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/NotificationHowTo.html)

- You can use the Amazon S3 Event Notifications feature to receive notifications when certain events happen in your S3 bucket.
- To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications.
- You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket.

### Replicating objects

[Replicating objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html)

- Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets
- Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.
- Objects may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. 
- By default, replication only supports copying new Amazon S3 objects after it is enabled. 
- You can use replication to copy existing objects and clone them to a different bucket, but in order to do so, you must contact AWS Support Center



## Hosting a static website using Amazon S3

[Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html)

- You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts.


## Server Side Encryption

### Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)

[Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html)

- Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. 
- Server-side encryption encrypts only the object data, not object metadata.
- Using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) allows you to set your own encryption keys
- The only thing you do is manage the encryption keys you provide.

## Working with Buckets

### Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage

[Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.html)

- In general, bucket owners pay for all Amazon S3 storage and data transfer costs that are associated with their bucket. 
- However, you can configure a bucket to be a Requester Pays bucket. 
- With Requester Pays buckets, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket.


### Using versioning in S3 buckets

[Using versioning in S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)

- Versioning in Amazon S3 is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. 
- You can use the S3 Versioning feature to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets. 

### Configuring fast, secure file transfers using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration

[Configuring fast, secure file transfers using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html)

- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. 
- Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of the globally distributed edge locations in Amazon CloudFront. 
- As the data arrives at an edge location, the data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

**Why use Transfer Acceleration?**
- Your customers upload to a centralized bucket from all over the world.
- You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents.
- You can't use all of your available bandwidth over the internet when uploading to Amazon S3.


### Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload

[Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html)

[How can I optimize performance when I upload large files to Amazon S3?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-upload-large-files)

- Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. 
- Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. 
- You can upload these object parts independently and in any order
- If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. 
- After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. 
- In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation.
