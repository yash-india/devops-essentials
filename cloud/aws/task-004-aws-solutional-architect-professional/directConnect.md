[Which type of virtual interface should I use to connect different resources in AWS?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/public-private-interface-dx)

- AWS Direct Connect (DX) provides three types of virtual interfaces: public, private, and transit. How do I determine which type I should use to connect different resources (public or private) in AWS?

  - To connect to AWS resources that are reachable by a public IP address (such as an Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket) or AWS public endpoints, use a public virtual interface
  - To connect to your resources hosted in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) using their private IP addresses, use a private virtual interface. 
  - To connect to your resources hosted in an Amazon VPC (using their private IP addresses) through a transit gateway, use a transit virtual interface
