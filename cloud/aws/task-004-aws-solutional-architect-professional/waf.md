[Cheat Sheet - AWS WAF](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-waf)

- AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
- AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that control bot traffic and block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
- You can also customize rules that filter out specific traffic patterns.

[What are AWS WAF, AWS Shield, and AWS Firewall Manager?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html)

- AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API.
- AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, Application Load Balancer, or AWS AppSync responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden).
